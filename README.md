# Weather App

An application that uses an API to search for a location and get the weather. 

# About the app

This app is a work in progress. It hasn't been optimized for mobile devices yet which is what is next up for this app. The basic functionality has been complete with the styling where I like it. The API is quite basic, it will only show the current weather. I'll try to look into some features where it provides more information about the forcast of the location you enter. For now, you can see the current waether of a location that you enter.

# Weather App

An application that uses an API to search for a location and get the weather

This is a work in progress so changes will be made as I go along and mostly to get as much practice with GitHub as much as possible. You'll see the changes as time goes along and more features are added, should be a fun journey!

UPDATE: As of 17th of October - App works! When putting in my API key for the apikey variable, the functionality works. Now I just have to style it as right now it doesn't look very...well it doesn't look nice. That's coming up next!
